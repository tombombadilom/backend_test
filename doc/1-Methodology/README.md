## Development Approach

For developing this Golang-based Live Ops Events System, we will follow a structured approach that emphasizes clean code, testability, and maintainability. The development methodology will incorporate best practices from Go development and microservice architecture.

### Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the codebase simple and focused on the requirements.
2. **Modularity**: Design the system with clear separation of concerns.
3. **Testability**: Ensure all components are easily testable.
4. **Performance**: Optimize for efficient handling of concurrent requests.
5. **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization.

## Project Structure

The project will follow a standard Go project layout:

```
/
├── cmd/                  # Main applications
│   └── server/           # The server application
├── internal/             # Private application and library code
│   ├── api/              # API handlers (HTTP and gRPC)
│   ├── auth/             # Authentication and authorization
│   ├── config/           # Configuration
│   ├── db/               # Database access
│   ├── models/           # Domain models
│   └── service/          # Business logic
├── pkg/                  # Public library code
│   └── proto/            # Protobuf definitions
├── scripts/              # Scripts for development and CI/CD
├── test/                 # Additional test applications and test data
└── vendor/               # Application dependencies
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Planning**: Define the requirements and design the architecture.
2. **Implementation**: Develop the code following the Go best practices.
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests.
4. **Review**: Conduct code reviews to ensure quality.
5. **Refactoring**: Continuously improve the codebase.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test the complete flow from API to database and back.
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure the system can handle the expected load.

## Quality Assurance

- **Code Linting**: Use `golangci-lint` to enforce code quality.
- **Static Analysis**: Use tools like `go vet` to catch potential issues.
- **Code Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage.
- **Documentation**: Document all public APIs and important internal components.

## Continuous Integration

- **Automated Testing**: Run tests automatically on each commit.
- **Automated Builds**: Build the application automatically.
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy the application automatically to staging environments.

## Version Control

- **Git Flow**: Use a simplified Git flow for version control.
- **Semantic Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for releases.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow a consistent commit message format.

## Documentation

- **Code Documentation**: Document all public APIs and important internal components.
- **Architecture Documentation**: Document the system architecture.
- **API Documentation**: Document the HTTP and gRPC APIs.
- **User Documentation**: Provide instructions for using the system.
